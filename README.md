# Codility Tasks
<p>These coding tasks are implemented with the logic which not only ensures the correctness, but also the performance</p>

# Build And Run:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/developerNoman/cppTasks.git`.
2. Create a build directory: `mkdir build` and `cd build`
3. Run the command: `cmake ..`
4. Run the command: `make -j`
5. In docker, build image `sudo docker build -t mycodilitytasks .` and then run the container with volume mapping `sudo docker run -it -v.:/app --name mycontainer mycodiltytasks`


##  How to build and run the executables

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j
cd Codes
./{executable_name}
```
